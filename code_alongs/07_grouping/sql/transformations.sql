/* 
Based on the EDA, I want to do the following 

- id -> food
- remove googleTopic
- value -> number_of_searches
- week_id -> week column and year column

Very good to SELECT before the transformation

*/

SELECT id AS food, value AS number_of_searches, week_id[1:4] AS YEAR, week_id [-2:] AS week FROM food;  

-- create a new table with these transformations
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cleaned_food AS (SELECT id AS food, value AS number_of_searches, week_id[1:4] AS YEAR, week_id [-2:] AS week FROM food  
);
